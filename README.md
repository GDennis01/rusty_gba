# rusty_gba
An attempt to emulate a GameBoy Advance.
This is my Rust(and emudev as well) learning project

## Progress so far
- Implemented Arm ISA decoder
- Implemented Thumb ISA decoder
- Implemented some basic logic for GBA memory(r/w operations)

## Next milestones
- Fully implement Arm ISA
- Fully implement Thumb ISA
- Refactor the code to make it cleaner and better structured
- Write a decent documentation
